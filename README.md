## Levels
1. How to Exit (Ex Commands): type `:q` or `:wq` then Enter
2. Basic Movement: `h j k l`
3. Word Movement: `w b e`
4. Line Jumps: `gg G`
5. Insert Mode: `a` + typing + `Esc`
6. Delete Basics: `dd`, `dw`, `x`
7. Yank & Put: `yy`, `p`
8. Line Bounds: `0`, `$`
9. Append & Open Lines: `a`, `o`, `O`
10. Change Word: `cw` (then type, `Esc`)
11. Delete to End & Replace: `D`, `r`
12. Counts: use `3w` to move multiple words
13. Undo/Redo: `dd`, then `u`, then `Ctrl+r`
14. Search Forward: `/target` then Enter; use `n`
15. Search Backward: `?alpha` then Enter; use `N`
16. Search Navigation: reach the 3rd occurrence with `n`

### Finish Celebration
After completing the final level, a centered full-screen celebration overlay appears with a confetti animation and a Play Again button. Press Enter or click Play Again to restart at level 1.

### Badges
Earn badges as you progress:
- Beginner Badge (üü¢): complete the early movement lessons.
- Search Master Badge (üîé): successfully use search commands (`/`, `?`, `n`, `N`).
Badges display in a bar under the title, and a toast appears when you earn one.

## Controls
- Navigation: `h` left, `j` down, `k` up, `l` right
- Words: `w` next, `b` back, `e` end
- Lines: `0` start, `$` end, `gg` first line, `G` last line (or `nG` to go to line n)
- Insert: `i` insert at cursor, `a` append after cursor, `o` new line below, `O` new line above
- Delete: `x` delete character, `dd` delete line, `dw` delete word, `D` delete to end of line
- Change: `cw` change word (deletes word and enters Insert)
- Replace: `r` then any printable character (supports symbols like `! @ # < > &`)
- Counts: prefix a number before commands (e.g., `3w`, `2dd`, `5x`, `5G`)
- Undo/Redo: `u` undo, `Ctrl+r` redo
- Exit Insert mode: `Esc` or `Ctrl-[`
 - Search: `/text` forward, `?text` backward; `n` next, `N` previous
 - Cheat Mode: toggle with `Ctrl+/` (or button)

### Search Edge Cases
- Empty search query does nothing.
- No matches: status shows `0/0`; `n`/`N` do nothing.
- Wrapping: `n`/`N` wrap around the buffer when reaching the ends.

## Challenge Mode
The Challenge Mode is a fast-paced game designed to test and improve your Vim command recall under time pressure. 
Users are presented with a series of command tasks to complete as quickly and accurately as possible. 
Each correctly executed command scores points, while speed and precision determine the final score.
This mode offers an engaging way to sharpen your Vim skills by combining rapid-fire challenges with real-time feedback, making learning Vim commands both fun and effective.

### **Challenge Types**
- **Speed Navigation**: Navigate through text quickly using movement commands
- **Quick Deletion**: Master deletion commands with time pressure
- **Advanced Moves**: Combine multiple commands for complex operations

### **Scoring System**
- **Base Points**: Earn points for each completed task
- **Time Bonus**: Faster completion earns bonus points
- **Accuracy Bonus**: Perfect execution provides additional rewards
- **Progress Tracking**: Challenge points are saved and displayed in your progress summary

Try to beat your highest score and see how quickly you can master essential Vim commands!

## Cheat Mode
Open the built-in, interactive cheat sheet to explore and practice commands on demand.
- Toggle: `Ctrl+/` or click the ‚ÄúCheat Mode‚Äù button
- Search/filter by name or description
- Commands grouped by category (Movement, Editing, Search, Other)
- Each entry shows keys, a short description, and an example
- Click any command to launch a mini-practice; you‚Äôll return to the cheat sheet after completing it
- Practiced commands are highlighted in the list

## How Validation Works
- Each level defines a target cursor location, target text, or target content layout.
- Validation is resilient to trailing spaces and blank lines where appropriate.
- You progress when the outcome matches the target; keystroke sequences themselves aren‚Äôt strictly enforced.

## Run Locally
- No build step. Just clone and open the file:

```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/renzorlive/vimmaster.git
cd vimmaster

# Switch to advanced-testing branch for latest features
git checkout advanced-testing

# Open directly in a browser (double-click on Windows)
start index.html  # Windows
# or
open index.html   # macOS
# or
xdg-open index.html  # Linux
```

If your browser restricts local file access, serve it with any static server, for example:

```bash
npx serve .  # then visit the printed URL
```

## Tech Stack
- **Plain HTML/CSS/JavaScript** - No frameworks required
- **Tailwind CSS** - Utility-first CSS framework via CDN
- **ES6 Modules** - Modern JavaScript with import/export
- **Local Storage API** - Client-side data persistence
